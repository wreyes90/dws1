		<h2>Working on cars</h2>
		
		<p>Ever since I can remember cars have always intrigued me. How they work and what can be done to improve them
		  is something that has always fascinated me. When it comes to cars although I like different car makes my heart
		  always go for the european manufactured cars, specially german cars like Volkswagen, Audi or BMW. I am only 24 years old
		  but so far I have owned many different German made cars. Here is a list of my cars in chronological order of ownership:</p>
		  
		<ol>
		   <li>1990 Volkswagen Golf GTI</li>
		   <li>1992 Volkswagen Corrado G60</li>
		   <li>1996 Volkswagen Jetta GT</li>
		   <li>2006 Volkswagen GTI <em>Turbo</em>
		   <li>1998 Audi A4 quattro</em>
		</ol>

		<h3>Snorkeling and Scuba Diving</h3>
		
		<p>Snorkeling or diving is an other of my top hobbies; I live in Puerto Rico that means that I live in a caribbean island that is
		 surrounded by beautiful beaches and coral reefs and since there is no seasonal changes trough the whole year it is like a never ending
		 summer. I first got my scuba diving license when I was 13 years old trough the <abbr title="Professional Association of Diving Instructors ">PADI</abbr>
		 Kids program. After that I climbed trough the stages and now have the Open Water license.</p>
		 
		<h4>Video Gaming</h4>
		
		<p>The final of my top 3 hobbies is video gaming. For me, video gaming has been a great part of mi childhood; it is an activity that I find
		extremely relaxing and there is no better therapy from the every day stress than playing a video game. Video gaming has helped me a grat deal
		in developing my english speaking skill, as mentioned earlier I live on a spanish speaking country, and has also helped me enhancing my mental skills
		like fast thinking, decision making and memory.</p>
